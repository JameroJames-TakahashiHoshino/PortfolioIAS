                <p class="app-title">Cyber Security Fundamentals — Step-by-Step Guide</p>
                <p>
                    Description: This write-app walks you through core cyber security concepts and hands-on steps to improve the security of a personal project or small website.
                    <br><br>
                    1. **Understand core concepts** — Learn confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA triad), authentication vs authorization, and threat modeling. Take 1–2 pages to define each with real examples (e.g., password theft = confidentiality breach).
                    <br><br>
                    2. **Create a threat model** — Identify assets (user data, admin panels), potential attackers (script kiddies, insiders), attack vectors (phishing, SQL injection), and likely impact. Sketch a simple diagram and rank threats by likelihood and impact.
                    <br><br>
                    3. **Secure authentication** — Explain best practices: use strong password policies, password hashing (bcrypt/argon2) with a brief example, multi-factor authentication, and session management (secure cookies, HttpOnly, SameSite).
                    <br><br>
                    4. **Protect data in transit and at rest** — How to enable HTTPS (obtain free TLS cert from Let’s Encrypt), enforce HSTS, and use encryption for databases and backups. Include commands / config snippets for certbot and sample TLS headers.
                    <br><br>
                    5. **Input validation & secure coding** — Show step-by-step examples: sanitize user input, prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, escaping output to avoid XSS, and OWASP Top 10 overview with remediation tips.
                    <br><br>
                    6. **Network & infrastructure hardening** — Guide to firewall basics, limiting exposed ports, using SSH keys instead of passwords, and keeping services updated. Add a checklist for server setup.
                    <br><br>
                    7. **Monitoring and incident response** — Set up simple logging (file + log rotation), basic intrusion detection (fail2ban), and a short incident response plan: identify, contain, eradicate, recover, and post-mortem.
                    <br><br>
                    8. **Backup and recovery** — Explain backup frequency, offsite storage, verifying restores, and a hands-on example: create cron job for nightly DB dump and rotate last 7 days.
                    <br><br>
                    9. **Continuous improvement** — Suggest regular vulnerability scans, using free scanners (e.g., automated tools), dependency audits, and a simple checklist for monthly review.
                    <br><br>
                    10. **Further reading & exercises** — Provide practice tasks: set up MFA for a sample app, fix a deliberately vulnerable endpoint, and write a one-page threat model for a class project.

                <img src="Images/Deploy.png" alt="Website Deployment WriteApp">
                <p class="app-title">Deploying a Website — Step-by-Step Deployment Guide</p>
                <p>
                    Description: This write-app gives a complete, sequential guide to deploy a static or simple dynamic website from local machine to live domain, including DNS, SSL, and simple CI/CD.
                    <br><br>
                    1. **Prepare your project for deployment** — Organize folders, create a `.env.example`, add a production build script, and ensure `.gitignore` excludes secrets. Explain difference between static vs dynamic deployment.
                    <br><br>
                    2. **Choose a hosting option** — Compare GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel for static sites and DigitalOcean / Render / Heroku for dynamic apps. Short pros/cons table and which to pick for student projects.
                    <br><br>
                    3. **Initialize version control & repository** — Stepwise `git init`, create README, commit, and push to GitHub. Add clear branch strategy (main for production).
                    <br><br>
                    4. **Link repo to deploy platform** — Example for Vercel/Netlify: authorize account, choose repo, set build command and output folder, and add environment variables securely.
                    <br><br>
                    5. **Domain & DNS setup** — Buy or use a free domain. Explain A, CNAME, and TXT records. Walkthrough: point domain to host with exact record values and how to check propagation (nslookup/dig).
                    <br><br>
                    6. **Enable HTTPS** — Show how to enable automatic TLS (Let’s Encrypt) via host dashboard or via certbot on a VPS. Include steps to force HTTPS and add HSTS header for better security.
                    <br><br>
                    7. **CI/CD basics** — Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow for automated build and deploy on push to main. Provide a minimal YAML snippet and explain steps.
                    <br><br>
                    8. **Environment & secrets management** — Use platform environment variable settings to store API keys and DB strings. Never commit secrets — demonstrate using `.env` only locally and platform vaults for production.
                    <br><br>
                    9. **Testing & smoke checks** — Create a pre-deployment checklist: run unit tests, lint, open deployed URL and verify assets, console errors, and form submissions. Provide sample test commands.
                    <br><br>
                    10. **Rollback & monitoring** — How to roll back to previous release, enable basic uptime monitoring (free tools), and set up simple logs/alerts. End with an exercise: deploy a small static blog and update content via Git.

                <img src="Images/VirusProtect.jpg" alt="Virus Detection WriteApp">
                <p class="app-title">Detecting Malicious Files — Step-by-Step Explanation</p>
                <p>
                    Description: This write-app explains how antivirus detection works in plain language and teaches stepwise methods to analyze suspicious files safely (for learning only).
                    <br><br>
                    1. **Safety first** — Always analyze suspicious files in an isolated VM or sandbox. Document how to create a snapshot and revert after testing. Never analyze on your main machine.
                    <br><br>
                    2. **Static analysis basics** — Explain signature-based detection: how hashes (MD5/SHA) and known signatures are used. Show how to compute a hash and query VirusTotal (describe manual use without automating keys).
                    <br><br>
                    3. **File metadata & strings** — Walk through extracting metadata (file type, headers) and using `strings` on binaries to find suspicious URLs, IPs, or commands. Give example commands and interpretation tips.
                    <br><br>
                    4. **Behavioral indicators** — Describe indicators of compromise: unexpected network connections, new autorun entries, persistence mechanisms, and unusual process creation. How to monitor these in a sandbox using Process Explorer and Sysinternals tools.
                    <br><br>
                    5. **Dynamic analysis** — Stepwise approach to run a sample in a controlled environment with network isolation, capture network traffic (Wireshark), and log filesystem/registry changes. Explain how to record and summarize findings.
                    <br><br>
                    6. **Heuristics and ML detection** — Explain heuristic detection and how modern antivirus uses behavior patterns and machine learning rather than exact signatures. Provide simple examples of heuristic rules (suspicious obfuscation, packing).
                    <br><br>
                    7. **Writing simple YARA rules** — Introduce YARA and walk through creating a basic rule to match a suspicious string or binary pattern. Provide a minimal example and show how to test it on sample files.
                    <br><br>
                    8. **Automated scanning & triage** — Describe building a triage flow: initial AV scan, reputation lookups, static/dynamic checks, and classification (benign, suspicious, malicious). Suggest tools for automation (sandbox APIs) but emphasize safe usage.
                    <br><br>
                    9. **Remediation & reporting** — If a file is confirmed malicious in a test environment, explain containment steps (delete, isolate, restore from backup), and how to document the incident for future learning or reporting.
                    <br><br>
                    10. **Practice lab & ethics** — Finish with lab exercises: analyze a benign, obfuscated sample and write a short report summarizing techniques used and why conclusions were reached. Add a short ethics note: only analyze samples you are allowed to and never distribute malware.
